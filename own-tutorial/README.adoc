= Synopsis
Playing around with K8s (Kubernetes).

= Installation
We'll use microk8s as our k8s environment. It works nicely on Linux,
has its own registry and is pretty easy to set up.

== Install + configure microk8s
`sudo snap install microk8s --classic`

=== Configure extensions
`microk8s enable registry dns dashboard ingress`
 
= Setup example app
We'll use Tomcat with a "hello world" webapp for getting started.

= Build + test image locally
== Build Docker image
`cd app
docker build -t k8s-playground/tomcat8 .`

== Test image in Docker
`docker container run -it -d --name tomcatcontainer1 -p 8082:8080 k8s-playground/tomcat8`
`open http://localhost:8082/SampleWebApp/`


= Build + test image in k8s

== Tag + push image to registry
The microk8s registry is running locally on port 32000. Let's build our image:

`docker build . -t localhost:32000/mytomcat8webapp:registry`
`docker push localhost:32000/mytomcat8webapp:registry`

In case you're getting an error "connect: connection refused", wait a couple of minutes and re-try the command. 

== Create a deployment

microk8s kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

=== Check status
microk8s kubectl get all --all-namespaces

This should return
- one pod (for your app, Status Running)
- one service (kuebernetes)
- one deployment (for your app)
- one replicaset (for your app)

==== Check pods
microk8s kubectl get pods -l app=mytomcat8webapp

=== Get summary
microk8s kubectl describe deployments mytomcat8webapp

=== Scale
microk8s kubectl scale deployment mytomcat8webapp-deployment --replicas=3

== Expose as LoadBalancer + Connect
microk8s kubectl expose deployment mytomcat8webapp-deployment --port=80 --target-port=8080 --type LoadBalancer

Find out the IP address of your pods:
microk8s kubectl describe svc

Open one of the Endpoints in your browser, e.g. http://10.1.0.19:8080/SampleWebApp
Et voil√† - you've got a running webapp in K8s!

= Setup Ingress
== Provide service definition for your app
microk8s kubectl apply -f service.yaml

== Provide ingress definition
microk8s kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

== Check it
microk8s kubectl get ingress

== Show endpoints
microk8s kubectl describe ingress mytomcat8webapp-ingress


open http://localhost/app1 - this should show your running mytomcat8webapp

= CLEANUP
In case you want to re-start from scratch, do
`kubectl delete -f ingress.yaml
kubectl delete -f service.yaml
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml`

If you renamed some / all of your objects, you can still manually get rid of them. E.g. to get rid of a leftover service, run

`kubectl get services`

to get its name, followed by

`kubectl delete service <your_service_name>`

After the cleanup, you should only have
- one service (kubernetes)
- zero pods
- zero deployments
- zero ingresses

= CLEAN SLATE
If you messed up completely, you can return Microk8s to its default state with
`sudo microk8s reset`
*CAVEAT* This will remove all add-ons, pods, services, namespaces etc. You've been warned.
